# COVESA Specifications for EU Data Act

## Introduction

The EA Data Act is a new EU regulation intended to make data more
accessible, fair, and usable, especially for data generated by
connected devices and digital services in the EU. The core ambition is
to strengthen the rights of both individuals and businesses to access,
use, and share this data, fostering a more competitive and innovative
European data economy.

The EU Data Act came into force in January 2024, with most provisions
applying from September 12th 2025. Technical requirements for device
designs to allow direct user access apply from September 12th 2026.

## Challenge

The EU Data Act gives users (consumers and businesses) the right to
access data they produce when using a connected product and share it
with third parties of their choice, either directly or by instructing
the data holder (often the manufacturer or service provider) to do
so. We believe the EU Data Act will force OEMs to re-architect data
access and governance, rebalance IP and openness, and rethink
connected‑services strategies, all under regulatory and competitive
pressure in a fast‑moving automotive data ecosystem.

Based on the above we assume that third party companies within the
automotive vertical will lobby for the use of common specifications
and standards to be made available that specifies how to structure and
provision of data rather than having to adapt to proprietary
specifications used by different data holders. This demand will
eventually lead to industry specific standards and specifications
enforced by EU. Therefore it would make sense to be ahead of such
standard and propose existing specifications to be used in the context
of the EU Data Act.

## Recommendation

**We recommend the use of the COVESA Specifications VSS and VISS when
exchanging vehicle-generated data over API** within the context of EU
Data Act as they offer a common, industry-accepted language and
behavior for defining and exchanging vehicle-generated data,
streamlining integration and making it easier for OEMs, service
providers, and third parties to collaborate and innovate.

**This recommendation is not enforced** upon the OEMs. It is up to
each OEM to take a decision whether to follow this recommendation or
to use other specifications and standards.

## Why VSS?

A number of potential specifications and standards that could be
chosen does exist but we decided early that the **COVESA** (The
Connected Vehicle Systems Alliance) **VSS** (Vehicle Signal
Specification) would fit the needs based on

- **Simplicity and Commonality**: VSS is basically a taxonomy for
  signals and data created in vehicles, and doesn't in itself
  specify protocols, packaging formats or access methods.

- **Openness and Extendibility**: Being Open Source removes license
  fees and similar hurdles, it is controlled by the COVESA members
  and community, and it is easily extendable if one needs to
  e.g. add proprietary vehicle signals.

- **Standardization and Interoperability**: VSS offers a standardized,
  easily understandable, and machine-readable structure for vehicle
  data, which simplifies data sharing, and enables reduced confusion
  and integration costs.

- **Faster Time-to-Market**: Since many tools and services can
  natively support or quickly adopt VSS, using this schema allows
  for quicker and more efficient development, testing, and
  deployment of new third-party integrations.

- **Eases Regulatory Compliance**: The standardized approach fosters
  compliance with data access, transparency, and portability
  requirements , supporting easier fulfillment of obligations such
  as third-party sharing in structured formats.

- **Reduction of Vendor Lock-In**: By making data portable and
  compatible across different platforms and providers, the risk of
  users or organizations becoming dependent on one supplier or
  proprietary format lessens.

- **Scalability and Innovation**: Open-source collaboration encourages
  the creation of new business models, cross-industry partnerships,
  and innovative services by making structured data more accessible
  to developers and businesses.

- **Enhances Consumer Trust**: Using a widely recognized schema that
  supports privacy and transparency can improve end-user confidence
  in how their vehicle data is being managed and shared with
  third-parties.

The above bullets together with e.g. the MoU between COVESA and ACEA,
signed July 29 2025 in which the COVESA VSS plays an important aspect
together with the COVESA VISS (Vehicle Information Service
Specification), demonstrates the general interest for using COVESA
VSS.

In our GitHub repo we have some examples of how a set of vehicle
signals could be mapped to the COVESA VSS (links below). In some cases
certain data haven't been defined yet in the VSS structure but it is
possible to extend the current specification in such case.

## Why VISS?

Just as with VSS there are a number of potential specifications and
standards that could be chosen but we decided early that the
**COVESA** (The Connected Vehicle Systems Alliance) **VISS** (Vehicle
Information Service Specification) would fit the needs since it shares
several of the advantages for using VSS but also

- **VSS fit**: The primary aim with VISS is to handle vehicle data
  structured according to COVESA VSS by exposing it by using e.g. JSON
  format over standard protocols such as HTTP or MQTT.

- **Uniform Front Door**: VISS can be run as a service in Vehicle, but
  works just as fine on an external server, acting as a uniform front
  door for applications and external consumers.

- **Standardization**: A common, well-documented interface
  specification reduces the need for OEM‑specific or supplier‑specific
  interfaces, which lowers integration cost and complexity for third
  parties.

- **Interoperability**: When OEMs use the same VSS data taxonomy and
  VISS interface specification, data consumers can reuse clients
  across multiple brands, supporting the EU Data Act’s push for
  interoperability and data portability.

- **Faster Time to Market**: Shared guidelines, reference
  implementations, and existing tooling around VISS shorten
  development and testing cycles for new services and apps.

- **"Access by Design"**: Several aspects of VISS aligns very well
  with the ambition of the EU Data Act such a being designed for get,
  set and subscribe to data in a fine-grained way, including
  specification of access control (which can be used to implement
  user-controlled access, consent and revocation).

The above bullets together with e.g. the usage of COVESA VISS in the
AUTOSAR Specification of Automotive API Gateway (Release 24-11 as per
November 27th, 2024), described as:

> This specification describes the functionality, API and the
> configuration for the vehicle service functional cluster, which
> provide access to a vehicle for non-AUTOSAR clients using a
> data-centric approach via the VISS protocol.

shows the general interest of using VISS as a specification for vehicle data sharing.

## Future

There are other projects at COVESA that are of interest in this
context, especially the COVESA VDM (Vehicle Data Model) project. It
can be described as the next-generation, cross-domain data model that
evolves and extends VSS rather than replacing it. It aims to provide a
common, semantically rich vehicle and mobility data model that works
both inside and outside the vehicle, across many domains, services,
and ecosystems. In short you could say that VSS is a taxonomy and VDM
will act as an ontology.

We will follow this initiative with interest and push for it in the
context of EU Data Act when suitable.
